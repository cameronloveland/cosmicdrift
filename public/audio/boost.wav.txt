Replace this file with: boost.wav

DESCRIPTION:
- Player-triggered boost sound (when player presses boost key)

- Non-looping, triggered once per boost activation
- Target volume: ~60% (set in Audio.ts)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Duration: 0.3-0.8 seconds
- Character: Aggressive, engine-like, thrust-forward
- Should feel powerful and direct (player action)
- More "punchy" than track boost pad sound
