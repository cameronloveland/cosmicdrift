PLACEHOLDER: Wind Sound Effect
================================
Replace this file with: wind.wav

DESCRIPTION:
- Loopable wind/hiss sound effect
- Speed-based volume (0-60% based on 80-260 km/h)
- Should loop seamlessly without audible seams
- Plays continuously during gameplay

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- White/pink noise based wind
- Subtle, not too harsh
- 2-5 seconds long for seamless loop
- High-pass filtered to avoid low rumble
- Gets louder as speed increases
