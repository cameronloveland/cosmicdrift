PLACEHOLDER: Track Boost Pad Sound
===================================
Replace this file with: boost_pad.wav

DESCRIPTION:
- Track boost pad activation sound (when driving over boost pads)
- Should feel different from player boost - more mechanical/picked-up
- Non-looping, triggered once per boost pad entry
- Target volume: Similar to player boost (~60-70%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Duration: 0.4-1.0 seconds (slightly longer than player boost)
- Character: Mechanical, power-up, pad activation feel
- Should convey "picked up speed from track feature"
- Slightly less aggressive than player boost
- Could include: Mechanical whirr, energy pickup sound, speed pad activation
- Differentiate from boost.wav to avoid confusion

NOTE: This sound will be automatically triggered when the ship enters a boost pad zone on the track.
